# vibrational analysis for defect-detection

Regarding the vibration data (which is collected by an accelerometer), they are presented as
follows:
X = acceleration on the x-axis, in m/sˆ2
Y = acceleration on the y axis, in m/sˆ2
Z = acceleration on the z axis, in m/sˆ2

we will be performing Spectral Analysis (fft and harmonics) of the fridge and identify
patterns between samples and the RPM of the device.

We will try to find the PSD(power spectral density) of the determine to catch any defects and determine whether the device is up and running or not
